# Lab 03: Python Conditional Statements for Cybersecurity

- **Platform**: Google Cybersecurity Certificate  
- **Lab Focus**: Using Conditional Logic to Support Access Control and Security Monitoring

---

## üß† Overview

This lab focused on writing conditional statements in Python to support decision-making in a cybersecurity context. As a security analyst, you were tasked with checking system update status and monitoring user login attempts. The exercises simulated real-world automation scenarios involving OS patch verification and login validation during specific hours.

## ‚úÖ Key Tasks Completed

- Wrote conditional statements using `if`, `elif`, and `else` to automate OS update checks
- Evaluated whether different operating systems (OS 1, OS 2, OS 3) required updates
- Used logical operators (`or`, `and`) to simplify and combine conditional checks
- Verified whether login attempts were made by approved users using comparison logic
- Stored approved usernames in a list and used the `in` operator to check access
- Determined login attempt validity based on whether it occurred during organization hours (Boolean logic)
- Combined multiple conditions to evaluate login attempts and display appropriate messages

## üíª Technical Skills Practiced

- Writing `if`, `elif`, and `else` conditional statements
- Using comparison operators (`==`) and logical operators (`or`, `and`)
- Working with Boolean values to represent access conditions and time-based restrictions
- Using membership testing (`in`) to check if a username exists in an approved list
- Writing concise and readable code for access control scenarios
- Testing different input combinations to verify conditional logic behavior

## üîÅ Reflections

This lab demonstrated how conditional logic is essential for automating decisions in security workflows, such as determining update needs or managing access permissions. By simulating login attempt validation and OS checks, the lab illustrated how structured conditionals can enhance the responsiveness and reliability of security tools.

While the individual tasks were straightforward, the underlying logic forms the backbone of many cybersecurity systems, including access control, alert systems, and log filtering tools.
