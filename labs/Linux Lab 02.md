# üñ•Ô∏è Lab #2: Working with Input and Output in the Linux Bash Shell

**Platform**: Google Cybersecurity Certificate  
**Lab Focus**: Input/Output Commands and Arithmetic Operations in the Bash Shell

---

## üß† Lab Summary

This lab focused on using foundational Bash commands to generate and manipulate output in a Linux shell environment. These basic skills are essential for navigating and interacting with the command line efficiently.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Tasks and Learnings

### ‚úÖ Generated Output with `echo`
Practiced using the `echo` command to print text to the shell. Tested both unquoted and quoted strings to understand how quotation marks help group words or special characters as a single argument.

### ‚ûó Performed Calculations with `expr`
Used the `expr` command to perform simple arithmetic operations. This included:
- Subtraction (e.g., identifying false positive alerts)
- Multiplication (e.g., estimating annual login attempts)  
Reinforced the importance of spacing between operands in shell arithmetic.

### üßπ Cleared the Shell with `clear`
Used the `clear` command to wipe the shell screen, creating a clean workspace for continued input.

### üß™ Explored Optional Exercises
Applied `echo` and `expr` independently to:
- Generate custom outputs  
- Perform additional calculations

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills Demonstrated

- Proficient use of `echo` for text output  
- Basic arithmetic with `expr` for shell-based calculations  
- Shell management using the `clear` command  
- Understanding of input/output structure and syntax in Bash  

---

These tasks helped build confidence in interacting with the Linux terminal and prepared me for more complex scripting and system management tasks.
