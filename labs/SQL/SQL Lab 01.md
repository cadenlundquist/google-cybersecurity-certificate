# Lab #1: Querying a Database to Retrieve and Sort Data

**Platform**: Google Cybersecurity Certificate  
**Lab Focus**: Foundational SQL Queries for Data Retrieval and Sorting

---

## üß† Lab Summary

This lab provided hands-on experience with foundational SQL commands used to retrieve and organize data from a relational database. These skills are essential for analysts, database administrators, and cybersecurity professionals who need to extract insights or identify anomalies from system records.

## ‚úÖ Key Tasks and Learnings

- Retrieved full table data using `SELECT *` to return all available data from the `machines` and `log_in_attempts` tables, confirming their structure and content.

- Used `SELECT` with specific column names (e.g., `device_id`, `email_client`, `OS_patch_date`) to retrieve targeted information.

- Investigated login attempts based on geographic origin and time by querying `log_in_attempts`, helping identify abnormal or unauthorized activity.

- Applied the `ORDER BY` clause to sort records by `login_date` and `login_time`, supporting timeline-based analysis of login behavior.
