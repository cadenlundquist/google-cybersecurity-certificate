**Platform**: Google Cybersecurity Certificate  
**Lab Focus**: Filtering Records and Selective Data Retrieval with SQL

---

## üß† Lab Summary

This lab provided hands-on experience with writing SQL queries to selectively retrieve and filter data from relational databases. These are essential skills for data analysis, troubleshooting, and system auditing.

## ‚úÖ Key Tasks and Learnings

- Queried specific columns (`device_id` and `operating_system`) from the `machines` table using `SELECT`, confirming the structure of device records and identifying a total of 200 machines.

- Filtered data using the `WHERE` clause to isolate machines running `'OS 2'`, which returned 80 devices that require system updates. Retrieved employee records from the `employees` table by filtering the `department` column, identifying office details for staff in both the Finance and Sales departments.

- Used a targeted `WHERE` clause to find the employee associated with a specific office, and then applied the `LIKE` operator to find all employees located in the South building, returning departmental context for follow-up action.
