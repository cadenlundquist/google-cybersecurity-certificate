## ‚úÖ Key Tasks and Learnings

- Used the `mkdir` command to create a new subdirectory named `logs` within the `/home/analyst directory`. Verified its successful creation by listing the directory contents.

![Mkdir Command Example](../images/linux_lab5_mkdir.png)

- Deleted the `temp` directory from `/home/analyst` using `rm -r`, and confirmed its removal through directory listing.

![Rm Command Example](../images/linux_lab5_rmdir.png)

- Moved `Q3patches.txt` from the `notes` directory to the reports directory, aligning file organization with the reporting structure and ensuring all quarterly reports were in one location.

![Mv Command Example](../images/linux_lab5_mv.png)

- Removed `tempnotes.txt` from the `notes` directory to declutter the workspace and confirmed the directory was empty afterward.

![Rm File Example](../images/linux_lab5_rm_file.png)

- Used the `touch` command to create an empty `tasks.txt` file in the notes directory, intended for tracking completed actions.

![Touch Command Example](../images/linux_lab5_touch.png)

- Opened `tasks.txt` using the `nano` text editor and added task notes. Saved and exited the editor using standard key commands and displayed the file content to confirm successful edits.

![Nano Editor Example](../images/linux_lab5_nano.png)
