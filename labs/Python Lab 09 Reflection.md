# Lab 09: Importing and Parsing Text Files for Log Analysis

- **Platform**: Google Cybersecurity Certificate  
- **Lab Focus**: Reading, Writing, and Splitting Security Log Data Using Python File Handling

---

## üß† Overview

In this lab, I practiced using Python's file-handling features to import, read, modify, and analyze a security log file. As a security analyst, parsing logs is a foundational skill that enables deeper threat detection and audit trail verification. The lab simulated a real-world task where I had to prepare a log file for analysis and create a whitelist of IP addresses permitted to access secure systems. Python‚Äôs `with open()`, `.read()`, `.write()`, and `.split()` functions provided the essential tools to complete these tasks efficiently.

## ‚úÖ Key Tasks Completed

- Assigned a filename to a variable (`import_file`) for use in `open()` statements  
- Used `with open(filename, "r")` to read a security log (`login.txt`) into a string  
- Applied the `.read()` method to extract all contents from the file  
- Displayed the raw text to inspect the log's comma-separated structure  
- Used `.split()` to convert the multiline string into a list of lines  
- Appended a missing log entry using `"a"` mode and `.write()`  
- Verified the file update by re-reading and printing the new contents  
- Created a new file (`allow_list.txt`) listing authorized IP addresses as a space-separated string  
- Wrote the IP address string using `"w"` mode and `.write()`  
- Read and displayed the `allow_list.txt` contents to confirm accuracy

## üíª Technical Skills Practiced

- Reading from and writing to text files in Python  
- Using `with open()` context managers to handle file I/O securely  
- Appending data using file mode `"a"`  
- Splitting strings using `.split()` to structure data  
- Writing and validating plain text output  
- Managing log data and implementing IP whitelisting for access control

## üîÅ Reflections

This lab helped solidify my understanding of how Python interacts with the file system‚Äîan essential skill in log management and automated analysis workflows. I gained practical experience using different file modes (`"r"`, `"w"`, and `"a"`), and manipulating file contents for both analysis and reporting purposes.

The `.split()` method, while making the text less human-readable, was a critical step in preparing the data for automated processing. Appending missing entries and confirming their integration added a realistic touch, simulating the kind of data hygiene work a security analyst must perform. Creating an IP whitelist emphasized how Python can support secure access practices by automating basic filtering and formatting tasks.

This hands-on experience reinforced the value of core file-handling skills for scalable security operations and audit readiness.
