# Lab 05: Python Functions for Security Automation

- **Platform**: Google Cybersecurity Certificate  
- **Lab Focus**: Defining and Calling Functions to Automate Security Tasks

---

## ðŸ§  Overview

This lab focused on the use of Python functions to automate repetitive tasks that are common in cybersecurity operations. Security analysts frequently need to run the same set of instructions multiple timesâ€”such as generating alerts or processing user data.

Pythonâ€™s function capabilities help encapsulate these instructions, making code easier to reuse, update, and manage. The lab simulated practical security-related scenarios such as raising alerts and managing system access by processing employee usernames.

## âœ… Key Tasks Completed

- Defined a basic function `alert()` that prints a standard security warning message
- Enhanced the `alert()` function using a `for` loop to simulate repeated alerts, reflecting real-time system monitoring
- Created a function `list_to_string()` that stores a list of approved usernames and iterates through them using a loop
- Applied string concatenation to convert a list of usernames into a single continuous string, simulating output formatting for reports or logs
- Improved output readability by adding commas and spaces between use
