## ‚úÖ Key Tasks and Learnings

### Checked Current Directory Information
Used the `pwd` command to verify the current working directory and `ls` to list its contents. This helped identify the structure and contents of the `/home/analyst` directory.

### Changed Directories and Listed Subdirectories
Navigated to the `/home/analyst/reports` directory using the `cd` command and identified subdirectories within it by listing its contents.

### Located and Read File Contents
Navigated into the `/home/analyst/reports/users` directory and used `ls` and `cat` to list files and read the full contents of `Q1_added_users.txt`, extracting specific user and department information from the data.

### Displayed Partial File Contents
Used the `head` command to view the first 10 lines of a log file located in `/home/analyst/logs/server_logs.txt`, identifying warning messages within those lines.
