# Lab #1: Managing Linux Applications with APT

- **Platform**: Google Cybersecurity Certificate  
- **Lab Focus**: Package Management in Debian-based Linux Systems

---

## 🧠 Overview

In this lab, I gained hands-on experience using the APT (Advanced Package Tool) package manager in a Debian-based Linux environment. The objective was to manage software installations and removals via the command line — a critical skill for system administration and cybersecurity tasks.

## ✅ Key Tasks Completed

- Validated APT installation by running the `apt` command to display usage and version info.  
- Installed Suricata, a network threat detection engine, using `sudo apt install suricata`. Tested its functionality, then uninstalled it with `sudo apt remove suricata` and verified removal.  
- Installed `tcpdump`, a command-line packet analyzer used for network traffic inspection.  
- Listed installed packages with `apt list --installed` to confirm `tcpdump` remained and Suricata was initially removed.  
- Reinstalled Suricata and verified it appeared in the installed applications list alongside `tcpdump`.
