# Lab 02: Python Variables and Data Types for Cybersecurity

- **Platform**: Google Cybersecurity Certificate  
- **Lab Focus**: Managing and Understanding Variables for Security Contexts

---

## 🧠 Overview

This lab focused on using Python to define, update, and assess variables and data types — a foundational skill for cybersecurity analysts responsible for tracking and automating security-related data (e.g., login attempts, user access lists, and device identifiers). The exercises simulated a real-world login monitoring scenario.

## ✅ Key Tasks Completed

- Defined variables representing security information:
  - `device_id`
  - `username_list`
  - `max_logins`, `login_attempts`
  - `login_status`
- Used the `type()` function to identify the data type of each variable
- Updated variable values dynamically to reflect system state changes (e.g., adding a new user)
- Used Boolean logic to compare values (`login_attempts <= max_logins`)
- Stored and printed Boolean values (`True`, `False`) to represent system states

## 💻 Technical Skills Practiced

- Python variable assignment
- Working with core data types: `str`, `list`, `int`, and `bool`
- Performing logical comparisons using relational operators (`<=`)
- Using the `print()` and `type()` functions for output and inspection
- Reassigning and updating variables based on new inputs

## 🔁 Reflections

This lab demonstrated how variables can be used to simulate real-world cybersecurity monitoring tasks, such as tracking login behavior or managing authorized users. It also highlighted the importance of understanding data types when writing scripts to automate decision-making processes.

While the concepts were basic, they are essential building blocks for more complex tasks like log parsing, alert generation, or access control.
