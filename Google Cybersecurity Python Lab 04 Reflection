# Lab 04: Python Iterative Statements for Security Automation

- **Platform**: Google Cybersecurity Certificate  
- **Lab Focus**: Automating Repetitive Security Tasks Using Loops

---

## üß† Overview

This lab focused on implementing Python iterative statements to automate repetitive tasks commonly encountered in cybersecurity workflows. As a security analyst, responding to network events like repeated login attempts, monitoring IP access, and generating system credentials can involve repeated processes. Python‚Äôs `for` and `while` loops provide the structure to make such tasks efficient and scalable.

The lab simulated real-world security scenarios such as failed connection logs, IP address validation, and employee ID generation.

## ‚úÖ Key Tasks Completed

- Created a `for` loop using `range()` to simulate multiple failed network connection attempts
- Used a variable (`connection_attempts`) to dynamically control loop execution count
- Applied a `while` loop to achieve the same result with a different logic structure, incrementing a counter to track attempts
- Iterated over a list of IP addresses to print them individually
- Compared each IP address to an allow list using a conditional inside a `for` loop to determine access
- Incorporated the `break` statement to halt execution when an unauthorized IP address was detected, simulating a security alert
- Used a `while` loop to generate employee IDs for the Sales department that were divisible by 5 and fell within a defined range (5000‚Äì5150)
- Included a conditional message once IDs reached a threshold (5100), demonstrating how logic can be combined with iteration to generate alerts or milestones

## üíª Technical Skills Practiced

- Writing and executing `for` and `while` loops in Python
- Using `range()` with both fixed values and variables
- Loop control with `break`
- Using `if/else` conditional statements within loops
- Iterating through lists and validating membership using the `in` operator
- Automating numeric generation logic and integrating alerts

## üîÅ Reflections

This lab illustrated the power of iteration in automating manual security-related tasks. Both `for` and `while` loops serve distinct roles depending on whether the termination condition is count-based or condition-based.

The ability to iterate over IP logs, validate access against an allow list, and generate employee IDs shows how these tools can scale cybersecurity processes. These foundational skills are essential for writing scripts that handle event monitoring, log analysis, and identity management efficiently‚Äîcornerstones of practical cybersecurity operations.
