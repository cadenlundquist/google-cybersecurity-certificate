# Lab 11: Debugging Python Code for Automated Processes

- **Platform**: Google Cybersecurity Certificate  
- **Lab Focus**: Identifying and Fixing Syntax, Runtime, and Logic Errors in Python Scripts

---

## üß† Overview

This lab focused on developing practical debugging skills by analyzing and fixing common errors in Python scripts‚Äîincluding syntax mistakes, runtime issues, and flawed logic. For security analysts, being able to diagnose and repair broken code is essential to maintaining reliable automations. Through hands-on debugging exercises, I learned how to interpret Python‚Äôs error messages and methodically resolve issues, improving both the functionality and robustness of the scripts. This lab also emphasized persistence, patience, and attention to detail‚Äîskills just as crucial as technical knowledge in a cybersecurity role.

## ‚úÖ Key Tasks Completed

- Fixed syntax errors in loops and print statements by adding missing colons and parentheses  
- Repaired list formatting by inserting a missing comma in a list of usernames  
- Corrected faulty logic in `if` statements by using proper comparison operators and aligned variable names  
- Resolved variable naming mismatches and indentation errors for better scope and logical flow  
- Replaced hardcoded list indices (e.g., `usernames_list[4]`) with dynamic values like `usernames_list[-1]` for better flexibility  
- Fixed method usage issues (e.g., incorrect `.split` usage without parentheses)  
- Read from a text file using `with open()` and applied `.read()` and `.split()` to convert text to a list  
- Removed unauthorized entries with a `for` loop and conditional checks, then wrote the updated data back to the file  
- Debugged a patch scheduling system by aligning OS names with correct patch dates through properly indexed conditionals

## üîÅ Reflections

This lab underscored the importance of debugging in real-world coding. Python error messages, while frustrating at first, are incredibly useful once you learn to read them properly. One of the key lessons was that fixing one issue at a time‚Äîand testing frequently‚Äîis more effective than trying to resolve everything at once. I also found that every mistake was an opportunity to deepen my understanding of how Python ‚Äúthinks.‚Äù Debugging may not be glamorous, but it‚Äôs one of the most valuable skills in any automation or cybersecurity workflow. This lab built both confidence and resilience in working through code problems systematically.
